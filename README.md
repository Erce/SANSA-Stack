# SANSA-Stack
This project comprises the whole Semantic Analytics Stack (SANSA). For a detailed description of SANSA, please visit http://sansa-stack.net. 

## Layers
The SANSA project is structured in the following five layers developed in their respective repositories:

* [RDF](sansa-rdf)
* [OWL](sansa-owl)
* [Query](sansa-query)
* [Inference](sansa-inference)
* [ML](sansa-ml)

## Release Cycle
A SANSA stack release is done every six months and consists of the latest stable versions of each layer at this point. This repository is used for organising those joint releases.
